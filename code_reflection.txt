The purpose of LinkedList.cpp is to implement a linked list data structure to manage and manipulate a collection of bids, such as those stored in a CSV file. The program allows users to load bids, display them, search for specific bids by ID, and remove bids from the list. It also provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction, making it easy to perform these operations. The linked list is implemented using a Node class to represent individual elements and a LinkedList class to manage the list. Key techniques include dynamic memory allocation for nodes, traversal of the list for operations like search and removal, and the use of command-line arguments to provide flexibility in specifying input files and search keys.

One of the challenges encountered in this program is ensuring efficient memory management, particularly in the destructor and the Remove method, where nodes must be properly deleted to avoid memory leaks. This is addressed by carefully managing pointers and ensuring that all dynamically allocated memory is freed when nodes are removed or the program exits. Another challenge is handling user input and edge cases, such as an empty list or invalid bid IDs. These are mitigated by adding checks and providing meaningful feedback to the user. Overall, the program demonstrates a solid implementation of a linked list while addressing common challenges associated with dynamic memory and user interaction.
